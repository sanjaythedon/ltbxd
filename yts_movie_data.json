That hustling has made him the target of derision among certain circles for peddling what have ended up being more novelty or faddish than useful products, but it has also placed more than a comfortable roof in Arlington Heights, Illinois over his and his wife Ethel's heads. Ethel, however, wishes that he placed as much effort into being at home with her as he does in selling; his current job of peddling five-spindle milkshake makers for Prince Castle which has him constantly on the road going from one drive-in restaurant to another. It is because of the beefs he has with the whole drive-in experience (bad food, bad service) in constantly eating at such establishments while on the road that he becomes enthralled with the concept of McDonald's Restaurant in San Bernardino, California, owned and operated by brothers Richard McDonald and Maurice McDonald - Dick and Mac. Unlike most of Ray's customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant. Primarily on Dick's initiative, the brothers have redesigned the whole concept of the drive-in restaurant to focus on quality food through a smaller menu of only the most popular items (hamburgers, fries, sodas), consistency in product so that customers know what to expect from time to time, change in the target market from lounging teenagers to families, and perhaps most importantly speed in having any order ready within seconds, many of these goals achievable through assembly line styled production. They had tried franchising previously, but failed in that they lost control over many of those aspects which made their San Bernardino restaurant successful. Despite believing Ray a bit off kilter (in other words, crazy), the McDonald brothers somewhat hesitantly enter into a contract with him to be their head of franchising. Ray's experience in the job is not without its problems, especially as his franchisees seem to be making more money than he is, he who is only breaking even. He is not averse to advancing ideas provided to him to get ahead - original ideas which are not his forte - he seeing the brothers as his biggest problem in they thinking small. These differences lead to a standoff between Ray and the brothers, the former who has a different goal for \"his\" business in profit and stoking his own ego seemingly his main priorities.\u2014Huggo",

Feeling guilty about leaving the man trapped, Joey regularly visits Hamby to bring him water, food, a sleeping bag, and a walkie-talkie. When he discovers what his brother is doing, Matt urinates on Hamby's head to reassert authority. Incensed when Joey continues bonding with the man, Matt drops an open pesticide canister into the hole to kill Hamby. Joey confronts Matt when he learns his brother used the stolen money meant for their mother to host a motel party. Matt responds by telling partygoers that Joey steals from retired people. Joey retaliates by revealing that Matt killed a man. Matt threatens and beats Joey.Joey runs back home where Carol's TV news program reveals the man in the well is actually Randy Michael Sadler, a fugitive wanted for murdering his wife and children. Joey returns to the hole and discovers Randy survived the pesticide by wearing the gas mask Joey dropped during the chase. Randy admits he stole a security guard's uniform and was trying to retrieve the stolen money for himself. Joey bargains to rescue Randy from the well in exchange for help punishing Matt. Joey brings Randy home after using a rope to get him out of the hole. Carol recognizes Randy from the news bulletin. Carol is shocked to discover Joey is helping Randy go on the run.At the same time, Matt reports Joey as the thief to police officers Smith and Crane, who are investigating the initial vandalism; Matt inadvertently implicates himself in the robbery (and knowing Randy was imprisoned in a hole but failed to notify police). Matt accompanies the two officers back to the house where a standoff ensues with Randy. Randy shoots both officers, but Joey stops him from killing them. Randy and Joey then take Matt to the hole in the forest. After forcing Matt into the well, Randy compels Joey to shout angry invectives at his brother. Randy then pushes Joey into the hole. Matt beats Joey unconscious. Randy starts limping away when Carol confronts him at gunpoint. Carol reveals she killed her abusive husband. Following a conversation about her troubled family, Carol shoots Randy dead. Fearing he killed his brother, Matt finally manages to rouse Joey. Matt and Joey embrace as Carol comes to their rescue.

The girls all go out to a high ledge, where Andy and his friends meet up with them. On a dare, and to impress Andy, Stacy agrees to jump off the ledge into the water below. Her happiness at getting Andy and everyone else's approval is short-lived when her bloody maxi-pad floats up next to her. Angry at Andy laughing at her and seeing Lydia laughing with the group, Stacy decides to \"call it\", having Lydia announce the time when her crush on Andy \"died\".Once school starts again, Stacy soon finds that Lydia and Andy are going out with each other. Feeling betrayed, Stacy stops talking to her. She sends a text message to an anonymous group that Lydia has hair on her nipples. Stacy even goes so far as to sabotage an \"entrance video\" she was making for Lydia's upcoming bat mitzvah with humiliating personal video clips. However, she does not send it.Stacy continues to try getting Andy's attention, also visiting Andy's grandmother's retirement home. She also tries make to herself look older and more popular than she is, arguing with her parents over attractions to have at her bat mitzvah and what clothes she may wear. Andy eventually offers to give Stacy her first kiss. Hiding behind the curtains of a Torah ark, they are interrupted by their teacher Rabbi Rebecca. This leads to more fighting between her and Danny.Lydia's mother Gabi, who does not know that Stacy and Lydia are fighting, comes over to the Friedmans'. She asks Bree for the entrance video for Lydia's bat mitzvah. Not realizing what is in it, Bree sends it to her. On the day of Lydia's bat mitzvah, the entrance video is played by DJ Schmuley. Although Stacy tries to get him to stop the video, the damage is done - when Lydia is about to walk into her party, she runs off and angrily tells Stacy off.When Stacy's bat mitzvah day comes, she goes up to read from the Torah from her parsha of Ki Tissa. Seeing Lydia and her parents not there, she stops and confesses everything to the gathered audience, and tells off Andy for being horrible and driving her and Lydia apart. After her confession, she finishes her Torah reading at Danny's urging.Afterwards, Stacy runs off to apologize to Lydia and asks her to come to her party later that night. When Lydia and her parents come, they are surprised to see that the party has been changed to be a new party for both Lydia and Stacy. The girls make up with each other, while Stacy starts dancing with Mateo, a different boy at her school who had often sought Stacy's attention.Sometime later, Stacy, Lydia, and their friends have a bake sale to help the retirement home.",
